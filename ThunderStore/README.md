#### A hammer granting you the power of Thor. Fly, Move faster, attack harder, & call upon lightning

<details><summary><b>Installation Instructions</b></summary>

### Windows (Steam)

1. Locate your game folder manually or start Steam client and :
   a. Right click the Valheim game in your steam library
   b. "Go to Manage" -> "Browse local files"
   c. Steam should open your game folder
2. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx\plugins folder
3. Locate azumatt.Mjolnir.cfg and azumatt.Mjolnir.Localization.cfg under BepInEx\config and configure the mod to your
   needs

### Server

Must be installed on both the client and the server for syncing to work properly.

1. Locate your BepInEx folder manually and :
   a. Extract the contents of the archive into the BepInEx folder.
   b. Launch your game at least once to generate the config file needed if you haven't already done so.
   c. Locate Azumatt.Mjolnir.cfg under BepInEx\config on your machine and configure the mod to your needs. If you are
   forcing configurations, these settings will be what everyone synchronizes to.
2. Reboot your server. All clients will now sync to the server's config file even if theirs differs. Config Manager mod
   changes will only apply if the person changing the configuration is an Admin on the server. The changes will be
   reflected live if the admin changes them while in game.
